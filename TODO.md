* Swicth to typescript
* Add option in settings to have either formatted output (prettified), minimized output, or default (do nothing, for speed)
* Fix path issues in the include statement and allow more characters
* Allow passing variables in the include statement
* Make a new statement '@layout' that can take in children & variables
